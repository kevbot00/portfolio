				- note that North / East latitudes / longitudes will be written as positive numbers, South/West latitudes / longitudes will be written as negative numbers
				- eg "117.8265Â° W" will be "-117.8265"
			- go to js/grayscale.js
			- in grayscale.js at about line 40, there is a line that starts with "map.setCenter(new google.maps.LatLng("
